# nw-build-test

> Tests building up a node-webkit app using browserify and 6to5

In theory, this should work, or, at least, it does at the moment,

```
clone
npm i
npm i -g nw
gulp (or gulp -d)
nw
```

Also trying to get a build working with node-webkit-builder, currently seems broken

```
gulp build
gulp package
```
